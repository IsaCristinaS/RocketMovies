# RocketNotes

RocketMovies is a web application designed to help users manage and organize their notes about movies and preferencies efficiently. 
This project was developed using ReactJS for the frontend, Vite for fast and optimized builds, Styled Components for modular and dynamic styling, and React Icons for easy integration of scalable icons.
React Router was used to create routes in the project.

The development process included 5 hours of guided classes, supplemented by additional hours dedicated to implementing and refining the learned concepts. This project was a hands-on experience in applying key frontend technologies to create a functional and user-friendly note-taking application.
